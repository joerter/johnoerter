Hi, nice to meet you!

I am passionate about building beautiful web applications that ${chalk.underline.blue(
  'delight'
)} and ${chalk.underline.blue('inspire')}.

I have over 8 years of experience working in a variety of industries building solutions to problems 
using software. I prefer to focus on the UI and work closely with end users and designers to craft 
elegant experiences. 
I believe that striving for ${chalk.underline.blue(
  'simplicity'
)} and ${chalk.underline.blue('clarity')} results in the best outcomes.
